# MIT Thesis Template

This is a heavily simplified version of the template provided by MIT [here](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/). It has enough to get started for a Course 6 MEng thesis, but do refer to the original template, LaTeX documentation, and MIT's thesis guidelines for further customization.

The source code is in the file `thesis.tex`, which can be compiled by running `pdflatex thesis.tex` in command line (assuming `pdflatex` is installed). The file `mitthesis.cls` needs to be included in the same directory.
